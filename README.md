# dungeons_and_linux

# Description

to be made

# Prerequisites

- rust (preferably the latest LTS)

# Current things that need to be fixed

in src/character/npc.rs

- fixe the randomize_traits function to select 3 unique values instead of the same one more than once

# Installation

Here is a simple guide on how you can clone this app for yourself in x steps

Step 1: clone the repository and go into the directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Halldor-Hrafn/dungeons_and_linux.git && cd dungeons_and_linux/
```

Step 2: build the app

```sh
cargo build
```

And then you got your project ready. To use the project, make sure to provide some arguments, since I have yet to implement error handling
